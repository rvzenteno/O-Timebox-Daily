# TimeBox Daily

**Smart daily timeboxing for Obsidian.**  
Plan your day in structured time blocks, automatically roll over unfinished tasks, and stay focused without manual setup.

TimeBox Daily creates a consistent daily planning system inside your vault using a practical TimeBox methodology.

## ✨ What It Does

TimeBox Daily helps you:

- Automatically create structured daily TimeBox notes
- Open today's TimeBox when Obsidian starts

- Plan your day in clear time blocks
- Customize your daily template
- Quickly access today’s plan from the ribbon or command palette

It is designed for users who want structure without friction.

## 📸 How It Works

Each day, the plugin creates (or opens) a note like:

TimeBox - March 12, 2026

Inside, you'll have:

- 🎯 Today's Focus
- ⏰ Time Blocks (Morning / Afternoon / Evening)
- 📋 Tasks
- 🧠 Brain Dump
- 📝 Notes & Reflections
- ✅ Completed Today

Unfinished tasks automatically move to the next day.

No manual copying. No daily setup.

## Why TimeBox Daily?

Most daily note systems require manual setup.  
TimeBox Daily enforces structure automatically — so you can focus on execution, not organization.
